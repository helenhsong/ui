# @helenhsong/ui

Shared React component library, built here and consumed directly by other
repos as a git dependency — no npm registry, no publish step.

Built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): components get vendored in via
the shadcn CLI, then tweaked and built on top of directly in this repo.

## Using it in another repo

```bash
npm install github:helenhsong/ui
```

`npm install` clones this repo, runs its `prepare` script (which builds
`dist/`), and links it in like any other package.

```tsx
import { SomeComponent } from "@helenhsong/ui";
import "@helenhsong/ui/style.css"; // once, e.g. in your app's entry point
```

Tailwind is a build-time detail of this repo, not something consumers
need — `npm run build` compiles it all down to the one plain `style.css`
above, so nothing here requires the consuming app to have Tailwind
configured.

### Pinning a version

Tracking `main` means every consumer picks up changes on their next
`npm install`. To pin, tag a release here:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags
```

and depend on the tag instead of the branch:

```bash
npm install github:helenhsong/ui#v0.1.0
```

## Setting up a project page

Every repo served at `helenhsong.github.io/<project>` starts from the
same template: a blank page with [`ProjectHeader`](src/components/ProjectHeader/ProjectHeader.tsx)
at the top (home link + a link to the project's README child page). Use the
[`$new-project` skill](skills/new-project/SKILL.md)
for the full template and automated workflow, from scaffolding through
deploying to Pages.

`ProjectHeader` owns its responsive layout: above 420px the header uses 32px
horizontal and 24px vertical padding, while its README uses the homepage's
30px content gutter; at 420px and below, both use the homepage's 20px content
gutter. The component does not reserve a scrollbar gutter, so short pages keep
their full width and projects with custom scroll surfaces do not gain a second
gutter. Consumers must not reproduce or override these layout rules.

## Developing in this repo

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # opens src/dev — a playground for previewing components
```

### Adding a component

```bash
npm run ui:add -- <name>   # e.g. npm run ui:add -- card
```

vendors a shadcn primitive into `src/components/ui/`. Tweak it there, then
re-export it from [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) — anything not exported
there isn't part of the public package. Preview it via `src/dev/App.tsx`.

For something fully custom (not a shadcn primitive), build it under
`src/components/<Name>/`, styled with Tailwind utilities and the shared
`cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils`, and export it the same way — see
[`ProjectHeader`](src/components/ProjectHeader/ProjectHeader.tsx) for an
example.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` — local playground with hot reload
- `npm run build` — builds the publishable package into `dist/`
- `npm run typecheck` — type-checks `src/` without emitting
- `npm run lint` — runs ESLint
- `npm run ui:add -- <component>` — vendors a shadcn primitive into `src/components/ui/`

## Design decisions

- **Distribution**: plain git dependency (via `prepare`), not npm/GitHub Packages — simplest to keep in sync across personal repos with no auth or publish ceremony.
- **Design system**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) — vendored primitives, `cva` variants, `cn()` merging — as the foundation to build and tweak components on top of, rather than hand-rolling each one.
- **Styling distribution**: Tailwind is compiled away at build time into one plain `dist/style.css`, not shipped as source. Consumers get a zero-Tailwind-required experience; only this repo's own build needs it.
- **Fonts**: not self-hosted, as a rule — bundling `@fontsource` packages inlined every font file as base64 into the stylesheet (Tailwind's CSS bundler inlines `@font-face` `url()`s regardless of Vite's asset settings), bloating it from ~4KB to ~150KB gzip. Consumers load fonts themselves. The one exception is `iA Writer Mono` (Regular only, for `ProjectHeader`'s header bar): it's [SIL OFL licensed](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) so bundling it is fine, and the single weight actually used costs ~50KB gzip (style.css: 5KB → ~55KB) rather than a whole family's worth.
- **Layout**: single package at the repo root. If this grows into several independently-versioned packages, revisit as an npm/pnpm workspace monorepo.
